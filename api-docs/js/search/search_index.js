example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\ncomponent:\n\n\n// ...\n\nlaydateOption = {\n  lang: 'en',\n  value: '1989-10-14',\n  done: (value, date, endDate) => {\n   // Get the generated value of the date, for example: 2017-08-18\n   console.log(value);seconds: 0}\n   // Get the date time object: {year: 2017, month: 8, date: 18, hours: 0, minutes: 0, seconds: 0}\n   console.log(date);\n   // Get the end date time object, only returns when range selection is enabled (range: true). The object members are the same as above.\n   console.log(endDate);\n }\n};\n\n\n\n🚀 standalone component\nWhen using NgxLaydateModule in a standalone component, we can use token NGX_LAYDATE_CONFIG to provide laydate\nimport { NgxLaydateModule, NGX_LAYDATE_CONFIG } from 'ngx-laydate';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  selector: 'my-laydate',\n  template: `\n    \n  `,\n  imports: [NgxLaydateModule],\n  providers: [\n    {\n      provide: NGX_LAYDATE_CONFIG,\n      useFactory: () => ({\n        // @ts-ignore\n        laydate: () => import('layui-laydate'),\n        path: 'assets/laydate/'\n      }),\n    },\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyLaydateComponent {\n  // logic\n}API\nDirective\nlaydate directive support following input properties:\n\n\n\nInput\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n[options]\nobject\nnull\nThe same as the options on the official demo site.\n\n\n\nLaydate Instance\nFor example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\ncomponent:\n\n@ViewChild('myLaydate', { static: true, read: NgxLaydateDirective }) myLaydateRef: NgxLaydateDirective;\n\nthis.options = {\n  min: '2016-10-14',\n  max: '2080-10-14',\n  ready: () => {\n    this.myLaydateRef.hint('Date selection is set within the range of  October 14, 2016 to October 14, 2080.');\n  }\n}Events\nAs Laydate supports the 'click' events, our ngx-laydate directive also supports the same click events but with an additional laydate prefix. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\ntypescript:\n\nonDone([value, date]): void {\n  alert('You have selected the date: ' + value + '\\nThe obtained object is ' + JSON.stringify(date));\n}\nThe '$event' is same with the 'params' that Laydate dispatches.\n\nIt supports following event outputs:\n\n\n\n@Output\nEvent\n\n\n\n\nlaydateInit\nEmitted when the laydate is initialized\n\n\nlaydateReady\nlaydate event: 'ready'\n\n\nlaydateChange\nlaydate event: 'done'\n\n\nlaydateDone\nlaydate event: 'change'\n\n\nlaydateClose\nlaydate event: 'close'\n\n\n\nYou can refer to the Laydate tutorial: Events and Actions in Laydate for more details of the event params. You can also refer to the demo page for a detailed example.\nDemo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run start\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn startThe demo page server is listening on: http://localhost:4200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2021 lanxuexing\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
